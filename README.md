# scintillation

Software meant to read output of the Septentrio scintillation measurement instrument
and analyze its data to monitor space weather. GNSS satellites transmit radio waves
and the amplitude fluctuations and phase shift that are measured on the ground are a
measure for the change of the refractive index of the medium.

## Code
The code is in python, and uses numpy, pandas and matplotlib to analyze the data.
